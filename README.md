# CSC343 - Computer Systems Design Lab with Hamed Fazli (Summer 2024)
Contents stored in this repository will be lab assignments assigned by Prof. Fazli where we write VHDL code within ISE Design Suite in order to implement multiplexers, dividers, ALUs, and others. </br>
Although it is not self-explanatory in the title of this repository, I will also include some CS342 materials since it is a co-requisite to the course; however, this repository will be mainly the lab assignments.
